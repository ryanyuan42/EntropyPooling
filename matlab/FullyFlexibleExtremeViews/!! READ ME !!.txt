Run the scripts 

- S_Grid_vs_MonteCarlo. This script compares the performance of 
	plain Monte Carlo versus grid in applying Entropy Pooling to process extreme views

- S_CVaR_Recursion. This script illustrates the discrete Newton recursion 
	to process views on CVaR according to Entropy Pooling

- S_Case_Study. This script estimates the prior of a hedge fund return
	and processes extreme views on CVaR according to Entropy Pooling
	IMPORTANT - This script is about the methodology, not the input data, which has been modified

- "S_GaussHermite_Grid. This script plots the zeros of the first 
	N Gauss-Hermite polynomials to compute an even mesh of N points
	that is slightly more concentrated in the body than in the tails
